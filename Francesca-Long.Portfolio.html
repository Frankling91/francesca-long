	<img Class="work-0" src="images/holland.png">
	<p>These are some samples of the illustrations I produced for a book titled ‘Twinned With’. 
	The illustrations show picture postcard towns across Europe, which happened to be twinned with towns in the UK. I created around 50 illustrations in total, all using Adobe illustrator and a graphics tablet.</p>

	<img Class="work-3" src="images/sauce boy-2.png">
	<p>Logo design concepts for an ‘easy squeeze’ sauce bottle, to become part of the Zaffron food range. The brief was to design something similar to the already existing logo for the American burger chain ‘Big Boy’. Basically a boy figure in a ‘50s’ style wearing blue overalls holding a sauce bottle, wooden spoon or whisk, with a clean vector style.</p></div>

	<img Class="work-5" src="images/lightbulb17.png">
	<img Class="work-6" src="images/lightbulb18.png"></div>
	<p>This light bulb character was created to feature as a mascot in a children’s textbook. It offers motivational comments and advice on solving problems. The design is very simple, based on the familiar glass bulb shaped light. The filament acts as a mouth and with the addition of large spectacles and gloved hands; this common household item is transformed into a lovable character.</p>

	<img Class="work-7" src="images/cinch logo concepts 1.png">
	<img Class="work-8" src="images/cinch logo concepts 2.png">
	<p>I was approached by a new self storage business to create a logo for their company. I developed a few ideas for a logo for them. One of which was a robot mascot type design, which came from the fact that their self storage business ran almost autonomously. The theme of boxes also needed to play a role in the design in someway, so I combined these elements to design a box like robot butler with a ‘C’ for Cinch on its hat and claw hands.</p>

	<p>Left: Concept design for a eco friendly ice cream hut with added educational tools. Has integrated tablets and tv screens and uses solar panels for a power source. It was intended to be made out or reclaimed and recycled building materials, with an old shipping container forming the main building. Right: Mock up art work for a 3D wall installation to be installed in an Antarctica themed area in an aquarium. The brief was make the hero ice creams look like they where busting out of the ice.</p>

	<img Class="work-14" src="images/snack pack-2.png">
	<p>Examples of concept designs for a snack pack collaboration between two brands, Jacob’s Crackers and Mini Babybel. The brief was to design packaging for a lunch snack pack that contained both Jacob’s crackers, a Mini Babybel and some fruit with the focus of it being a fresh and healthy ‘grab and go’ option. The design had to be suitable for both adults and children and would be stocked in coffee shops and food outlets at train stations in large city areas like London</p>

	<h1>Veterans for Wildlife</h1>
	<hr class="solid">
	<img Class="free-3" src="images/V4Wposterportfolio.jpg">
	<p>This Is an early poster design for a black tie fundraiser event being held by the Charity ‘Veterans for wildlife’. The Charity enlists ex service men and women to help protect and conserve endangers animals in Africa. Their logo is a Rhino which is why I chose it for the main image for the poster. I also used the brand’s colours (coral pink, yellow, bluish grey, orange and grey) in the design. The poster is double sided with the backside showing details of the three separate events, so it also works as a handy leaflet.</p>
